# Dipole_Electric_Field

This simple program computes the three components of the electric field generated by a dipole. In this case the dipole is generated by an electron and a proton. We can see how the main consists in very few lines of code. This is thanks to the right implementation of the classes "Particle" "MaterialPoint" and "Position". In particular, "MaterialPoint" inherits "Particle" and "Position" data members. 
The class "VectorField" help us in conctructing a vector field in a point P. For this reason "VectorField" inherits from Position.
